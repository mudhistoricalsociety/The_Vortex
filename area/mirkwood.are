a sylvan elf scout~
A Sylvan Elf scout is offended at your intrusion!
~
The Sylvan Elves are a good people, but centuries of subjection to the
violences and prejudices of other races have made them wary and very
hostile toward outsiders. However, if you're tough enough, perhaps he'll
back down. As natives of Mirkwood, they are virtually imposssible to see
if they don't want to be seen.

Entrance to Mirkwood~
You have entered the quasi-magical Elven forest of Mirkwood, populated by
Sylvan Elves and their mysterious allies. Strangers are frowned upon here,
so be on your guard. It is rumored that many different races of Elves
actually inhabit this forest, in various parts and sometimes they are
carefully hidden, away from the prying eyes of strangers.

There is a sign tacked to a tree nearby.

The Path Through Mirkwood~
You are advancing along a narrow path that runs deep into the forest of
Mirkwood. Giant, ancient trees tower over you to either side, and sweet
songbirds sing in their lofty branches. However, despite this serene scene,
you can't shake the feeling that you're being watched.

A Broad Path~
This branch of the path widens out after a short distance, and you notice
signs of heavy use, evidently by non-Elves, as Elves do not leave footprints.
The trees are thinner and smaller in this part of the forest, giving the
impression that it has been recently cleared.

watch out for intruding Orcs or Goblins. They dislike strangers in general,
and detest interlopers into their personal areas even more. Expect a violent
reception if there is a guard present...
