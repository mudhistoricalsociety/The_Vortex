it seems that the eq I made a long time ago has 13 for base ac and is anti-good/evil
the newer eq I have has the base of 30 and doesn't have those flags 
think it might be a bug or something and am wondering if it can be fixed

I like for large players to not be able to bully little guys...
At the same time, a small player should not be able to endlessly taunt
a larger char.

What I propose is putting in fight timers on chat channels for curse words.
This would put in many new variables to the role-playing...
"thems are fighting words"

A larger player could taunt a little player... The little player is safe
from abuse  The larger player can use obscene language, but gets a fight timer.
The smaller player can use their wits while advoiding obscene language.
If the smaller player circumvents our dictionary of obscene language, then the larger player has extra fire for his or her silly campaign.
"Thats right, call me a F4cking donkey licker will ya... you fear me."
I've only been playing for 20 minutes you moron, there is no way I can put up a fight

I think chat channel should be pretty clean anyway, is it feasible to put in a check for obsene language?   While I have no intention of censoring the mud, this  might be a nice angle for having folks censor themselves.

Although we have many rules in place, the mud should be able to run itself
for the most part when we are not there.  :-)

Such is the fact when a good player picks any class.  It's something that has plague
the godwars mud genre since its creation.  There are usually a handfull of players that
know what they are doing, so which ever class they choose tends to be overpowered.
All this simply because most of the mud refuses to admit that there might be some
more tactics and such that they may need to learn.  Lord forbid someone admit to
themselves that they arent as good as they think they are.

I like the idea of notes.  I like the idea of passing information on to discuss stuff.. But, can people please stop using notes to whine about other players?
Nobody wants to read it, I'm sure.  It just looks annoying, and I have a hard time deleting them from my show list..
We all know this is a pKill mud.  Yeah, that means that some people are stronger than others.  This is a GAME above anything else.  Your char will die on occasion, maybe even Leorick =P
Just accept it, get revenge.. But, c'mon.. Can't we all just get along (j/k).  The people on here can be a lot of fun, that's why I stay..  Everyone bitches sometimes (see this note)..
But, if people constantly abuse the note system by trying to hurt other players, only bad things will come of it.  The note posting ability could be removed or something.  Plus, you'll just get on people's bad side... 
I'm sorry this isn't formatted well, I'm not all that great with these things.. I just wanted to say that I like this mud, and just wish people would try to make it work more..
Thanks, DasIch...

yeah, marriages would be quite difficult to manage.  It would basically have to be a fight for which of the guys gets the ONE(?) female on this damn mud.. which would be me.  Of course, I have 3 chars (which may or may not be char'd female).. I still don't think that would actually satisfy the masses of men..
ESPECIALLY since the lone female things the idea of online mud marriages is completely retarded, and wouldn't do it.. (unless perhaps for a super-nice set of armor - one that puts steel/diamond armor to shame..)
Of course, the people in the mud could agree to be pretend married.. Call it "domestic partnership" and just be happy to be in homosexual relationships with eachother.  It would be one step forward in the equal treatment of gays in society.  Sadly, I don't think most of you guys would want that, though..
Why the hell am I writing this note?

As the title said, this mud shouldn't go to waste.
All of you, be the immortals, have worked hard on this mud.
It would be a lot of wasted hours. Don't let that happen.
Look. You have some, although not a lot of old players.


Start advertising the mud more. That's what you gotta do.
Period. Try various boards, those that are popular in specifics.
I know a few sites. The Mud Connector, which I'm sure
we all know already. However, http://www.fark.com will get
this mud a lot of hits. Just post a few times on there and I'm
sure you'll get a lot of new players rolling in. I've seen it
happen on other MUDs in the past. If you want players, post there.
If you want even more players, post some where else.

Advertising is the frickin' key to getting players!
