0 'GHOST TOWN'~
This is purely a simple hack-n-slash area with the interesting added feature
that you can't recall... You have to fight your way through the many powerful
high level undead that populate this place. To a good mudder its heaven. To
someone who flees when fighting the children in Mud School, its probably gonna
be considered impossible. Either way, have fun.

The Town Square~
You have come to the Town Square. You can proceed in several directions from
here across the square, which is now nothing more than a flat square of
scorched earth and decimated vegetation, or down one of the side streets.
There is a well in the middle of the square.

You are standing in the middle of the town square, at the well. Paths stretch
past houses and shops in every direction. There must still be some water in
the well, as a small amount of grass has managed to grow around it.

  "Here is the final resting place of the Evil Baron Shereck, former

   here by the powerful magic of Xanad, the ArchMage of Anon, their
   rest may not be disturbed by their undead allies. Pray, whoever reads

Inside The Crypt~
The interior of the crypt is dark, damp and cramped. It looks as though

difficult, as do the hanging cobwebs, with strands as thick as your wrist.
You hope you don't run into the spinner of these webs.

The Crypt Proper~
Three doors and a staircase allow escape from this area, and that is a
prominent urge you have right now as you glance about the hellish murals
on the walls, and the rotting corpses hanging in metal frames from the 
arched ceiling.

A Room In the Crypt~
These three resting places that lead off the Crypt's main chamber are all
identical- a raised stone sarcophagus with a bas-relief of the image of its
occupant in life embossed on the lid. Other than that, the place is bare. Or
is it...?

The Path To The Garden~
This path runs past some very ugly, dead plants that look like they've had
the life drained from them by some disturbingly healthy looking plants with
thorns that look like teeth...

The Path To The Garden~
This path runs past some very ugly, dead plants that look like they've had
the life drained from them by some disturbingly healthy looking plants with
thorns that look like teeth. You suddenly curse as you nearly fall into a
small hole in the center of the path which was partially covered by a nest
of branches.

The Path To The Garden~
This path runs past some very ugly, dead plants that look like they've had
the life drained from them by some disturbingly healthy looking plants with
thorns that look like teeth. The garden gates are directly ahead... Peering
through, you become reluctant to enter. It looks like a virtual maze...

A Bolthole~
Here the cowardly necromancer Xantharus lurks, terrified of the evil he
brought to his village. He would do anything to escape, but is currently
too petrified to leave his hole.

The Garden~
You find yourself lost in a tangled maze of thorny bushes and rotted trees
that all seem to move as if with a life of their own. Howls and screams of
pain and delight occasionally rent the still air- otherwise you are engulfed
by a silent dimness that only exaggerates the already-eerie quality of
your surroundings.

The Garden~
You suddenly enter a brightly-lit glade full of towering oaks and fresh,
green grass. Here the powers of good have managed to create a foothold in 
this realm of darkness, to aid those stranded or trapped here. You may rest
in peace (if you'll pardon the inappropriate euphemism) for as long as you
wish here.

A Murky Mist~
You are plowing through a thick mist that has suddenly enshrouded the trail.
You can still make it out beneath your feet, but only barely. Howls, screams
and shouts of anger and terror ring out on all sides, and you feel fear 
clutching at your heart. You think you can make out a small stone building
to the east. A gaping hole looms out of the fog in the ground to the right.

The Dragon's Lair~
Dragons of all types, alive or undead, keep certain habits, and one of them
is how they decorate their lair. So when you enter and see treasure splashed
everywhere, along with a generous helping of blood and fried corpses, you are
at least 90% sure you have entered the lair of one...

A Dark Tunnel~
Can it be? YES! An escape route! From this tunnel emanates the sweet smell 
of green grass and fresh air. You can clamber through and escape, though
the tunnel is so narrow you doubt you'd be able to return through it.
