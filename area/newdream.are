But be warned! The summoning of demons is very dangerous and
it will cost you greatly to do so. Be wise and cautious about
when you choose to summon the demons to do your bidding, and
be sure to allow yourself time to recover before doing another
summons.
To summon the demons and change your item you must chant <itemname>

If you choose to explore the wonders of dreamscapes, be very careful to follow the clues given 
to you. The answers lie within them. When you begin your journey through the maze, be warned not 
to attempt at guessing your way to enlightenment.  To do so and guess wrong, will lead to your 
demise, in which you will surely pay with your blood. Vertigo is not afraid to take your head,
nor to force you to escape only to lie helpless at the Temple of the Creators. One last thing
you should know, if you find need to protect yourself from demons conjured from hell, speak the
words   'God protect me'   and you will be protected as long as the spell holds.

The Dream Master's Hidden Chamber~
You slip through the trapdoor, and it slams shut behind you. You feel a chill run down your back 
as you see the door disappear before your eyes. You are trapped! Suddenly the shadows seap together 
and form an ominous figure. You cower in fear as the Dream Master steps towards you. An ancient 
tome lies upon an altar behind the Dream Master.

E
tome book ancient~
The inscription on the cover reads "Dreamscapes". You open the book and find that every page of 
this enormous book is blank, save the first page. You begin reading the passage: Of all the realms 
we seek to conquer, none are quite so difficult as that which is contained in our own mind, hidden 
deep within our dreams. The most powerful of beings are those who have conquered this hidden realm. 
The pages herein appear to be blank, but they merely await to be written. Each entity writes a 
different tale, some of victory, some failure, but most... death. The only way to achieve one's 
full inner power, is to reach the level of high lucidity. To begin your journey, you must first 
correctly answer the Dream Master's riddle. Only then are you worthy of his guidance. Be wise in 
your choices, failure to reach high lucidity, once the journey has begun, will prove to be 
disasterous. 

You begin to set the book back onto the altar, and notice a riddle inscribed on the back of the ancient tome.

The Prism Room~
You are standing in the prism room. White light enters into an enormous prism in the center 
of the room, creating natural spectrums all over the room. You wonder what this room has 
to do with anything, then you quickly realize that dreams often contain elements that are 
out of place. The white light is coming from the North, aren't you always told to go towards 
the light? As you ponder the question, you hear the Dream Master's voice... "You must use the 
magnificent bow to face this fear, do not leave this room until you have mastered the bow".

spectrum~
You look at the spectrum of colors. The spectrum contains the colors violet, blue, green, 
yellow, orange, and red. Like a rainbow, only a rainbow is somehow different...

~
E
rainbow~
You recall that a rainbow is a natural spectrum. This must be the magnificent bow the Dream 
Master spoke of! You remember that a rainbow is refracted light, and thus opposite in the order 
of the colors of the spectrum. The order of the colors of the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, 
green, blue and violet. Something about the order of the colors must be very important.

~
E
prism~
A giant prism is being shot through with
a brilliant white light, and spewing
forth hundreds of natural spectrums. A
closer look at the spectrums may reveal
an even deeper beauty.
