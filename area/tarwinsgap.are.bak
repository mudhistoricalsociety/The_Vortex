Cliff Face~
Tracing your hand across the cliff you feel every noke and cranny.   
Parts have been cut off and black marks cover this wall.  It seems at  
other times you can almost make sense of the black marks as if they were  
a long forgotten language.
The Cliff face continues North and South.

Fields of Sand~
Grass quickly starts to die underneath you.  Each step is as if it

little patches of plants that seem to almost thrive from the spilt blood.

Blasted Lands~
War and battles still endure even in this deadly enviroment.  Screams  
almost to be unhuman can still be heard coming from what now seems to  
be all around.  Horrid monsters and soldiers seem to almost poor from  
the south.

Rock Wall~
Almost as if you never saw it from far off you come to a huge wall of  
rock.  Looking up you notice that this wall spans up further then the  
eye can see.  In awe you find yourself staring at this rock wall for a  
long time.
