turnkey~
a drunken turnkey~
The turnkey snores loudly as he sleeps off another binge.
~
His job bores him to tears. No one ever tries to escape. His duties are
limited to escorting prisoners to and from their cells, and occasionally
beating a noisy or frightened prisoner into submission. So he spends most
(heck, ALL) of his time drinking.

Job satisfaction is SO important, really. I mean, if you don't enjoy your
job, what have you got?

a price, of course.

off duty guards here at any given time, playing cards, dice, etc. to while

KEEP OUT!

A trapdoor leads upward to the city square, where prisoners who are
sentenced to death are led for their execution.

end up here rarely leave in one piece. And even if they do, they are usually

being subjected to cruel tortures on the nightmarish devices below.
