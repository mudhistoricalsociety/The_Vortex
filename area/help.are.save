0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

-1 BOT BOTTING~
BOT
Botting is not allowed. If you are running commands and are not there
when anyone asks you a question, you are botting.  You must be able to 
respond to an immortals question within 5 seconds of them asking. The
only botting allowed is spell botting.  

* If you exp bot, you will lose all exp and have your stat's halved.
* If you quest bot, you will lose all your equipment and all qps in your
  score.
* If you stance bot, you will have all stances put back to 0.
* If you run a morting bot, you will be paradoxed -- relentlessly.
* If you mine bot, you will lose all gems and ore currently on you, and
  possibly equipment.
* Do not pill, staff, or potion bot.
* Because the type of botting is not listed, it doesn't mean there are no
  other bots that can be punished.

***The ONLY legal botting allowed is SPELL BOTTING.  If this bot happens
   to use spell training in a manner that benefits your character in ANY
   fashion other than spell levels (ie: if you gain ANYTHING ELSE, exp,
   qp, mined items... ANYTHING) you WILL be SEVERELY PUNISHED.

Keep in mind, these are MINIMUM punishments.
You CAN be denied, deleted, or worse!

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

~

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~
Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors, and only when the weather is bad.
It calls down lightning bolts from God.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

0 CHANGES~
#707-05-02 You can no longer grab a victim while you're flying, you
	 need to use snatch in this case. Snatch is now timered and
	 works as an area goto. (Loimos)
07-23-02 Two crash bugs squashed.
07-23-02 Awaken slightly changed.  It lags the user about 50% more,
         yet auto-attacks and does damage in proportion to its
         casting cost.
#010-24-02 Development has re-started.  Lots of things have been
         removed that never were used.  The code looks more legible.
         Traveling to yourself is no longer possible in any form,
         and Jedi are nearing completion.  Expect more code cleaning
         later, and note to Kline about anything gone horribly odd as
         it will more than likely be his fault.
10-27-02 Jedi are now in testing.  Darkfire is currently the only
         ptester, but two more will be accepted.  I take no
         responsibility for how ever gimped this class may currently
         be.  This means DO NOT BITCH if you fight one and lose horribly,
         and DO NOT BITCH if you are one and lose horribly.
#112-12-02 We are now in the process of adding MXP support for advanced
         clients such as zMUD.  Currently only room names, exits, and
         descriptions have been modified, but more will come shortly.
         Note:  This will have absolutely no affect on non-MXP compliant
         clients, unless you enable MXP, in which you will just recieve
         a bunch of HTML-looking garbage.

command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.
~

0 CLANS~
Clans are a somewhat unique experience here, in that you gain
clanpoints for killing people, and are able to buy various things
with them.  For now, you can only purchase Turrets, Spies, Tanks,
and Wall Fortifications.  Later on there could potentially be more
fun things to use clanpoints for.

Outside of being able to purchase the items listed above, clans can
also attack each other's Castles, or spy on one another to learn more
about their infrastructures.

Eventually, a mini-game system will be implemented for raiding clan
castles, and clan leaders will be allowed to purchase vnums and design
their own castles.  Clan recalls (secondary recalls) are a possibility,
as are numerous other things (eq, guardian mobiles, etc).

Implants and humanity are the most important factors to a cyborg.  Implants are
what make them what they are, and affect humanity as they are added.  Humanity
is quite important as it is the controlling factor in exactly how much of a machine
a cyborg is.

See help HUMANITY and help IMPLANT for more details on each.

0 GOLCANDA BEAST DARK GOLCANDA~
A vampire's inner beast plays a large part of a vampire's power and largely
determines the fashion in which a vampire fights.

GOLCANDA	- Golcanda is attained by casting blue magic spells
until your beast reaches 0. Generally, golcanda vampires take less damage
then a beast vampire, at the expense of dealing less damage.  Golcanda 
vampires also suffer fewer daytime penalities than beast vampires, but are
weaker at night.

BEAST		- Beast is obtained from berserking until your beast
reaches 100 (it will continue to raise up to 200).  Beast vampires deal
more damage than golcanda as well as take more damage.  Beasts get a great
frenzy and are stronger at night than golcanda's, while much weaker at 
day.

DARK GOLCANDA	- Dark golcanda is obtained by killing other vampires
after you have reached golcanda. This can take a very long time to obtain
and many vampires never achieve this level. Dark Golcanda are the most
powerful vampires overall, but take a lot of active pk to achieve.
~
4 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,

already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

Some useful numbers for new imms are:
Limbo: 2, The Temple of Midgaard: 3001, The Entrance to Mud School: 3700,
The Chat Room: 1200, The Dark Crypt: 30001, The Temple Altar: 3054,

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

0 GUARDIAN~
Syntax: cast 'guardian'

This spell summons a demonic guardian to aid the caster in combat (or 
just to show off to your friends ;).
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.  If you 
attack while hidden, the surprise attack will inflict one and a half 
times your normal damage (assuming your opponent cannot see you).

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

-1 HOLY~
Heal          - A small heal          [Heal       ]
Banish        - Transport target away [Banish     ]
Godsbless     - The power of God      [Godsbless  ]

Michael       - Damages enemy         [Summon     ]
~

4 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~

0 HUMANITY~
Humanity determines exactly what a cyborg is; either pure machne or
a half-breed.  Humanity can be either good or bad, in it's own unique
way.  A lower humanity will give increased damage and extra attacks;
at the expense of 2x the normal casting lag, 1/2 the normal regen rate,
and a lower parry/dodge ability in addition to randomly going berserk.
On the other hand though, a higher humanity doesn't grant the same
damage and attack bonuses, but also doesn't incur any of the penalties.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.

04-26-02 I changed the PERS macro, it's quite useful as I now know.

3 IMOTD~
~

0 IMPROVE~
Syntax: cast improve <object>

This spell enables a quest created object to contain more bonuses.  The 
object must be worth at least 750 quest points.  Casting this spell will 
enable it to hold an additional bonus comparable to the bonuses that can 
be added to non-created items - ie: an extra +10 hitroll or damroll on a 
weapon, an extra +5 hitroll or damroll on a piece of armour, etc.  The 
maximum number of quest points that the item can contain is also 
increased by an addition 500, plus 10 per status point.
~

0 INFRAVISION~
Syntax: cast infravision <character>

This spell enables the target character to see in the dark.
~

1 INLAY~
Adds the attributes associated with gems to a 
piece of forged gear. Different gems do different
things when inlayed into a piece of forged gear.
You must have cast prepare on the target item before
attempting to inlay gems into it. See 'HELP PREPARE'.

Syntax:
   inlay <gemname> <itemname> nospell(nospell is optional)

note: adding the nospell argument will make it so that perfect gems
      will NOT add their assigned spell.

Number of gems that can be inlayed into each metal:
   copper = 2
   bronze = 3
   iron   = 4
   steel  = 5

The better cut, polish, and clarity a gem has, the
better the bonuses that will be inlayed into the gear.

Also see 'HELP FORGE','HELP SMELT'.
~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'

will become visible when they attack.

~

0 JEDI~
QDH v1.00	(Quick and Dirty Helpfile v1.00)

Combo Commands:
 jover	      jflip
 jupper       jback
 jslice       jswipe
 jslash       jroll

Light Force Commands:
 forceheal    forceabsorb
 forceshield  forcemindtrick
 forcesight

Neutral Force Commands:
 forcespeed   forcejump
 forcepush    forcepull

Dark Force Commands:
 forcegrip    forcerage
 forcedrain   forcelightning

General Commands:
 jedigain     sabercraft
 combatstyle

Other Notes:
 You start at rank 1, Apprentice.  Ranks go upward from
 there into Initiate, Guardian, Knight, Master, and
 finally Lord.

 Ranks affect nearly every aspect of being a Jedi, and
 have a random chance to increase each TICK based on
 your levels of Attack, Stance, and Defense.

 Jedi are limited in the equipment they can wear without
 suffering SEVERE penalties to combat.  You can wear
 equipment on your FEET, ABOUT, and BOTH HOLD slots
 without any penalty.  Other equipment is allowed to be
 worn as rank increases.  So an Apprentice can only SAFELY
 use 4 pieces of equipment, whereas a Lord can SAFELY use 
 13.

 You must also sabercraft your weapons to be able and
 perform combos.  This makes it unuseable by any non-Jedi,
 but also greatly enhances it.

 You can only have a total of 50 levels of power between
 all of your combined force powers.  This count does not
 include Attack, Stance, and Defense levels.  It also does
 not include your levels in Light, Neutral, or Dark.  This
 is purely a raw count of the total of all your individual
 force power levels.

 Once you learn something, you are FOREVER UNTIL DETOX stuck
 with it.  This applies to anything under jedigain.  Also,
 Light Side powers can not be used if your Dark Side is
 greater than 4.  Dark Side powers can not be used if your
 Light Side is greater than 4.  Keep this in mind.

Equipment Chart (Total Eq Safe To Wear):
 Apprentice:  4 pieces
 Initiate  :  5 pieces
 Guardian  :  6 pieces
 Knight    :  8 pieces
 Master    : 10 pieces
 Lord      : 13 pieces

~

5 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

~

0 MANA~
Syntax: cast 'mana' <name>

With this spell, the caster draws the energy from around them and focuses 
it into the target person (defaulted to themself).  This is very 
exhausting for the caster, but allows a faster recovery of mana.

2) You can use the circle technique.
3) You are adept in backstabbing, and perform it quicker.
4) You are adept in circling, and perform it quicker.
5) You have perfected your art, granting enhanced damage and the art of tumbling.
~

6 MCLEAR~
Syntax: mclear <player>

This resets the target players stats to their correct value.
~

7 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

MEMORY reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.

0 MINE MINING ARMOUR~
To create your own armor you will need to do a few things.  They WILL NOT be
easy and it WILL take time.

First off you will need to MINE for your resources.  Collect raw ORE and GEMS
by using the MINE command.  If a room has been mined already it will show 
#3(Mined)#n.  After you collect these resources you will have to combine them.

Use SMELT to combine your raw ore into useable bars of metal.

Use FORGE to make armor and weapons from your bars of metal.

Use INLAY to add gems to your weapons and armor to make them stronger.

-1 MONK~
 Monks are the pure embodiment of living weapon.  They focus the energies
around them to aid them in combat.  They can calm their mindand use that 
calm to manifest thought into reality.  All monks fight unarmed, for with
the freedom of movement comes speed and agility to dance around the weapons
of their opponents.  Monks have the ability to master the art of combat
stances and unarmed combat. 

   Combos:  By executing the right combination of combat maneuvers, a monk
            can perfrom actions of wonder.
   Chains:  By executing the correct combination of combos, a monk release
            their full fury upon their enemy.
   Voice:   A truly powerful monk can call down the very powers of the
            heavens to aid them.
   Focus:   While meditating, a monk can regain the calm in their mind.
   Chi:     Chi is the spirtual energy that greatly increases the power
            of a monk.  However, chi creates a terrible drain on the monks
            endurance.
   Relax:   After combat has ended, a monk should release the stored chi
            energy, so they will not be overly fatigued.
   Technique: A monk must learn all the techniques of his order to become
              the perfect fighting machine.

-1 APOCRYPHIC POWERBLOCK POWERBLOCKS POWER BLOCK~
Powerblocks are what define your character.  Each school has a set list
of powers and skills that you can train.  Choose your schools wisely as you
can only learn 3.  Powerblocks, however, are not without some downfalls.
First, when you class Apocryphic, you set a "Race" for yourself, and with
this comes 4 blocks that you are restricted from using.  Aside from that
however, the only other restriction to powerblocks is that there are
opposites which can not be used together.

To see the list of schools and powers that you have use the power command.

                    The Powerblocks are:

                       Fire    Water
                       Earth   Wind
                       Holy    Evil
                       Time    Space
                       Plant   Animal
                       Arcane  Luck
                       Order   Chaos
                       Life    Death


*** You may not have a school, and it's opposite ***

Simple prompt: [%hH/%mM/%vV]
Combat prompt: [%N:%F/%n:%f]
Stat prompt: [%xX] [+%pHIT/+%PDAM] [%cAC] [%hH/%mM/%vV]
My prompt: *%x Exp* {-%h/%Hhp-%m/%MMn-%v/%VMv-} (%f)

Remember, you can switch between the default prompts and your customised
prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.

~

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* P-K Quest: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~

0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~

0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~

0 QUESTSPELL~
Syntax: cast quest

This spell creates a quest card.  The quest-point value of the card is 
the same as the amount of primal the caster has at the time of casting

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RACE~
A race, or racial name, is something special to an apocryphic.  Instead of people
seeing what class you are on look (IE: Werewolf, Druid, etc.) they will see your
race that you defined when using autoclass.  So if you were to type
autoclass apocryphic Numan 4 your race name would appear as a "Numan" and your
banned group would be 4, time and luck.

The Groups are:
1.  fire/chaos
2.  earth/plant
3.  holy/order
4.  time/luck 
5.  arcane/space
6.  life/water 
7.  death/wind

You set the first group and another group is chosen for you.

0 RULES~
Things will be added here at anytime, so be sure to check this frequently:
1) #1Being disrespectful to an administrator includes swearing to an immortal
   #1or in any form of association with an immortal.  This is punishable by
   #1denial or deletion.
2) #1If anyone is demanding to an administrator, the administrator reserves
   #1the right to not do it.  Ask once and only once or leave a note.  Asking
   #1more than once constitutes being demanding.  If you can't leave a note,
   #1ask a fellow player to leave a note for you.  If the thing you want to
   #1tell an administrator is a bug, then you may repeatedly ask.
3) #1Use your common sense.  If you are about to do something which you think

0 SHADOW~
Shadows are adept assassins and spies, but they perform almost any task
if it is profitable enough. They usually hold several aliases and keep
their true identities secret to everyone. Living solitary lives, Shadows
work alone in most cases. When they do team with others, their true goals
are normally oblivious to others. Although Shadows will take a life without
hesitation, most are not of evil alignment. Shadows are almost always
neutral (but never good). They work for profit, not pleasure. Shadows rarely
join guilds. They work quiety, keeping a low profile. They like to stay away
from any attachments. Guilds may be a source of equipment and information, but
Shadows are extremely resourceful individuals. Whenever a Shadow if discovered,
he disappears without a trace. Or does he?

  Shadows have the following commands:
   Mastery   - Display your masteries, and skills gained from each.  Learn new
               masteries using mastery learn <string>.  First level masteries
               cost 250 primal.  All other levels are achieved through using
               the first skill associated with them.
   Backstab  - Initiate a fight from the shadows; doing considerable damage.
   Circle    - A weaker, in-combat backstab relying on speed and stealth.
   Shadow    - Allows you to silently follow an indivudual.
   Conceal   - Disappearing is not only an art, but a necessity.
   Runeweave - Shadow are somewhat practiced in a few magical arts that prove
               key to their survival.
   Traproom  - Traps are one of the key skills of a practiced Shadow.
   Thirdeye  - Creates a small magical eye that you can look through.
   Tumble    - Key to escape, a mastered Shadow can grapple and throw their
               opponent in combat.

A novice Shadow must hold some attachment to a guild in order to first learn
the basis of their skills.  A thieves guild leader is typically sought out,
for thieves and Shadows tend towards similar motives now and then, leading to a bit
of an unformal alliance between the two sects.  After learning the basics of each
mastery, a Shadow will need to further their masteries on their own.

Also read help MBACKSTAB, MTRAP, MRUNE, and MTRACKING for details on each mastery.

disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

0 STATUS~
This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of 
how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal or above, or an viable avatar you will gain 1 status point.
If you however cap an avatar without those stats, i.e an avatar with 1
or 0 pkills then you will be paradoxed.

0 SUICIDE~
Syntax: commit suicide

As an avatar, you have the option to commit suicide. When you commit suicide
you become one of the Spirits of the Damned.  The advantage of this is the
ability to use a class, against mobs, advance your class, and fight other
players in the arena.  However, you CANNOT be involved in PK in any way,
you cannot pk, cannot be pk'd, and cannot interfere in others fights.  In 
order to rejoin the realm of pk, you must use the REPENT command.  Suicide 
is a powerful command, in that it allows you to play as an avatar without
fear of being pk'd.  Due to this powerful aspect, it also carries a heavy
price, so be warned before you use it to avoid a fight.  The cost is your
status * 200 (minimum of 1000, maximum of 10000), which is deducted from
your max hp/mana/move.
Anyone who is a Spirit of the Damned will have their clan set to DAMNED, and
cannot change their title until they repent.  Spirits of the Damned may also
take part in deathmatches.
YOU MUST HAVE A MINIMUM OF 10,000 in each of hp, mana and move.

most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.

only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and

con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have

immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their

bonus to the maximum blood which they can store at once.

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.

0 WOLF WEREWOLF~
Werewolves are creatures of the night, and notoriously hate Vampires with
a crazed passion.  Werewolves are typically humans who have draw themselves
into a closer relationship to Gaia than others, and have therefore been
granted the awesome power that comes with being such a creature.  Not only
do Werewolves have a close bond to Gaia, enhancing their natural senses and
skills, they are also able to channel vast ammounts of raw energy from the
moon at night.  The power Werewolves draw from Gaia comes in the form of
certain disciplines centered around various animals in the natural flow of
life.

  Werewolves have the following commands:
   Disciplines   - Display your disciplines.  Learn new disciplines with
                   discipline learn <discipline>.  You can view your
                   current knowledge in a certain discipline by using
                   discipline <discipline>.
   Rage          - Force yourself into a wild frenzy if your discipline
                   advancement is far enough.
   Calm          - Remove yourself from rage if your discipline advancement
                   is far enough.

   Other commands are learned as you advance individual disciplines, and
   there are far too many to be listed here.
